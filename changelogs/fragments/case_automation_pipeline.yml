minor_changes:
  - "'ocp_must_gather': Implemented **Disconnected/Air-Gapped** environment support via `ocp_disconnected_mode` and `ocp_disconnected_registry`."
  - "'ocp_must_gather': Implemented **Acronym-based Component Selection** (e.g., AAP, ODF) for Must-Gather image lookup, simplifying user input."
  - "'ocp_must_gather': Implemented **Disk Space** and **Cluster-Admin Privilege** safety assertions for pre-flight validation."
  - "'rh_case_create': Added logic for **Generalized Case Creation** payload (conditionally includes OpenShift fields)."
  - "'rh_case_create': Implemented **Structured JSON Logging (`to_nice_json`)** in handlers for clean AAP output."
  - "'rh_case_create': Introduced custom Jinja templates for initial case comment and final summary."
  - "'rh_token_refresh': Refactored for highly reliable token retrieval using semantic sorting."

bugfixes:
  - "Corrected variable precedence issues that led to 'undefined variable' errors in handlers when mixing role defaults and dynamic facts."

trivial:
  - Update main `README.md` to reflect all new roles, playbooks, and features.
  - Added centralized documentation file `CASE_OPTIONS.md` for valid API inputs.
  - Updated `ocp_must_gather` README with safety check details and disconnected usage instructions.
  - Added detailed docstrings to all new role variables and parameters for clarity.
  - Added `MUST_GATHER_IMAGE_OPTIONS.md` listing all valid Must-Gather image acronyms and their descriptions.
  - Added `CASE_SEVERITY_OPTIONS.md` and `CASE_TYPE_OPTIONS.md` for valid case creation parameters.
